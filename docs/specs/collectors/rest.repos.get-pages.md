    "ordering": "Use endpoint-supported sort/direction only; Link next or documented cursor is authoritative; detect repeated cursor/URL.",
    "termination": "Exhaust next link/cursor; missing total is unknown; budget exhaustion yields partial. Pagination never proves token-wide or enterprise-wide completeness."
